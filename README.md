## rofi-tmux

Quickly switches tmux sessions, windows and tmuxinator projects on rofi launcher. Automatically integrates with [i3wm](http://www.i3wm.org) for a smoother switching workflow, if you have multiple workspaces.

### Use Case

I developed rofi-tmux to optimize my workflow. As a user who rely completely on tmux for anything shell related, I wanted to have a fuzzy finder switcher (rofi), to locate any tmux session or window with seamless integration with i3wm. I guess I've got spoiled by fuzzy finders. Watch the screencast bellow and you'll see what I mean :)

### Features

- Switch or kill any tmux session.
- Switch or kill any tmux window, either globally or within the current session.
- Load any tmuxinator project.
- Cache last tmux session and window for fast switching back and forth, decreases the number of keystrokes.
- Integration with i3wm for automatically finding and switching to the right workspace seamlessly.
